This PROJECT investigates unsupervised learning approaches for anomaly 
detection, emphasizing the significance of techniques like clustering, 
association rules, and dimensionality reduction. It outlines the importance 
and various applications of unsupervised learning, setting the foundation for 
understanding anomaly detection methods. The study examines different 
approaches, including statistical, machine learning, proximity-based 
methods, and time series analysis, highlighting their relevance in identifying 
anomalies across diverse datasets.
Special focus is given to anomaly detection in time series data, exploring 
different types such as point outliers and subsequence outliers. Techniques 
like autoencoders, STL decomposition, and DBSCAN are discussed for their 
effectiveness in handling time series anomalies. The report also delves into 
multivariate time series analysis and forecasting methods, such as ARIMA 
and VAR models, while exploring deep learning techniques like LSTM and 
CNN, demonstrating their application in both anomaly detection and 
forecasting scenarios
